# Underwater Images Color Correction

A web application that lets you magically correct the colour of photos you've taken underwater!

## ⚠️ This project is under construction. It is not currently available nor finished.

## Why ?

When you take photos underwater, colours disappear quickly because the water absorbs certain wavelengths of light (depending on your depth). So colours like red will quickly disappear.
This programme will try to restore the original colours.

Warning: the result will not be the same as if you had used a flash. It's more like cheating, but it can give very good results.

## How to use ?

Futur instructions will be added soon.

## How it works ?

Using javascript, rust and webassembly (all transformations are done in your browser, no back-end !).

This repo was inspired by the algorithm at https://github.com/nikolajbech/underwater-image-color-correction.
